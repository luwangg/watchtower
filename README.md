## Dev notes

* Couldn't get TP-Link adapter to show up on Macbook. Also `iwconfig` doesn't exist in OSX. Trying Ubuntu VM
* scapy works in Kali VM using the apt installed Scapy. Will have to see if venv works/is necessary
* `sudo pip3 install scapy` resulted in `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools'`
    * Needed to `sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools` then re-run pip install
*
